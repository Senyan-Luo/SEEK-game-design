Although our simulation is not a digital game, it connects with serious games well because they share a common objective of educating players on some topic. I consider Turn-it-in relay race a non-digital serious game, which addresses how students manage their time and balance between life and academic responsibilities. Moreover, our relay race is an abstraction of a real struggle every student knows - finishing a research paper on time. From the simulation, participants will learn and experience the consequences of their choice as well as its impact on a team’s overall performance.  <i

                    of immersion in videogames. Although our game is not a videogame, immersion is still very present.
                    In the creation of any game with a narrative, and especially in a simulation, immersion is vital in
                    making the experience engaging or believable. Our game is meant to simulate a student’s lifestyle
                    choices when under stress. The players had to make decision, each choice having advantages and
                    disadvantages, that reflected the choices made by students under a deadline. The gameplay advantages
                    and disadvantages had to reflect the real life consequences of these decisions or else the players’
                    immersion would be broken and our message would be unclear. Without the basic principles of

                <p class="designer-statement"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>My research paper is about how video gaming can have positive effects on kids with ASD. It has very little to do with our simulation design but I think they both share come core concepts. For example, they both express the importance of motor, cognitive, and social skills. In my paper, I explain how video games can aid in the overall performance of kids who typically lack in those areas. In our simulation, motor skills are vital in order to win because in order to win, the players have to balance the plate and run at the same time. Additionally, in both my paper and our simulation, there is a stress on communication. For many kids with autism, communication and social skills are always difficult to maintain and control. Video games can create virtual relationships with these kids to help with that. In our simulation, communication is vital because each team needs to know when to run and when to pass the plate. <i

                <p class="designer-statement"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>My research paper is about live
                    streaming. It is very far from the Sim Design that our team created; however, there is a connection
                    between live streaming and the Sim Design. This is because live streaming help people to simulate
                    doing any exercises in a right way. The Sim Design that our group created is based on relay race.
                    People usually warm themselves up before they start running or playing any sports. For instance, I
                    usually watch one of famous Korean comedian’s live streaming. His live streaming is all about
                    playing soccer. His manager videotapes him playing soccer. Before he plays soccer, he tells viewers
                    that do not forget to warm yourself up. By warming up, it releases rigid parts of the body and
                    reduces the risk of heart damage. We tell people, who are participated in our game, do not forget
                    warm themselves up. Therefore, we can prevent participants’ injuries. It's not easy to make a new
                    game, test someone, and simulate it, but through this group project, I always have to simulate
                    before I do something, and simulation seems to be an important element that is needed everywhere.<i

                <p class="process">In our first brainstorming session, my team got excited about creating a game that can simulate some aspect of college life. Several great ideas were generated during the conversation, and all four of us came to a consensus that our simulation would address the strss college students experience. Senyan proposed a relay race that would simulate students who are trying to meet a deadline to turn in their research paper, and each of the participants will make independent choices that will decide how they run. Our team decided to build upon this simulaiton idea, and we used a whiteboard to design and iterate on the logistics.</p>

                    <div class="game-img-2" align="center"><img src="./images/rule_1.jpg" align="center"><figcaption>Beside logistics, our main goal of these two playtesting rounds is test the design of our rules. Specifically, we need to know how to tweak the questions and the options. Will participants lean towards certain choices? Are these questions successful at simulating how students choose under stress?</figcaption></div>
                    <p class="process">We playtested twice with peers from our discussion section and gained valuable insights on design logistics that needed improvements. Based on participant feedback, we identified some main problems and proposed the following changes: 
                        <ul id="feedback-1">
                            <li>Before game started, we gathered all the participants to cover the general directions and rules of the game. However, participants had trouble remembering what question they needed to answer before they are sent to their respective stations. To solve this problem, we decided to announce only the general rules and purpose of the simulaiton at the beginning, then we send the runners from both teams to their respectice station, where they will get the specific question that they need to answer and ask the facilitor at the station for clarification. </li>
                            <li>We took too long to get the players ready. Senyan forgot to bring the weighted backpacks to station two, and Andy forgot to put the tennis ball on one of the player's plate. To prevent the hassle, we planned to get set up all the materials at each station prior to game start, and once the players made their choices, we will gear them up and prepare them for their turn.</li>
                            <li>A player passed the plate to someone who is on the opposite team! This happened because he did not remember who was on his team, and there was nothing that distinguished one team from another. To prevent this from happening, we will line up two teams on two seperate sides, and give everyone a sticky badge to write either "A" or "B" to indicate their team.</li>
                            <li>Participants from two teams inadventently made the same choices on every question. This means that the options were uneven and people chose options to avoid any time punishment. There are two ways we plan to solve the problem. First, we will extend the running distance. Since our initial distance was set at 30 feet per racer, even a 3-second time punishment is too significant. We will increase the distance per racer to 160 feet. In addition, we will tweak the duration of time punishment in every option and introduce more balance, so that participants will not lean towards one option without much thinking. </li>
                        </ul>

The choices each participant makes will result in the consequences of their actions and determine their overall performance in the game. The goal is to turn in your research paper to your professor while managing important aspects of your daily life. You will be broken off into two groups of 4, and each group will assign number 1 through 4 to every participant. Number 1 from both team will report to station 1, and vice versa. Both stations 1 and 3 will be positioned at one end, and stations 2 and 4 will be positioned at the other end. The plate acts as the baton of the relay race. As each person travels to the next station, they will have to balance a plate with different objects, because as life gets harder, there is a lot on everybody’s plate (wink wink). The objective is to finish the game as quickly as possible, while making conscientious decisions about your life. Whoever finishes first is the winner.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>
