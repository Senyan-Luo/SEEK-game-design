                    serious games should use the four pillars of learning as a guiding design framework. Although our
                    simulation is not a digital game, it connects with serious games well because they share a common
                    objective of educating players on a given topic. I consider Turn-it-in relay race a non-digital serious
                    game, which addresses how students manage their time and balance between life and academic
                    responsibilities. Moreover, our relay race is an abstraction of a real struggle every student knows
                    - finishing a research paper on time. In the simulation, participants will learn and experience
                    the consequences of their choice as well as its impact on their team’s overall performance. <i

                    In the creation of any game with a narrative, and especially in a simulation, immersion is vital in
                    making the experience engaging or believable. Our game is meant to simulate a student’s lifestyle
                    choices when under stress. The players had to make decision, each choice having advantages and
                    disadvantages, that reflected the choices made by students under a deadline. The gameplay advantages
                    and disadvantages had to reflect the real life consequences of these decisions or else the players’
                    immersion would be broken and our message would be unclear. Without the basic principles of

                <p class="designer-statement"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>My research paper is about how video
                    gaming can have positive effects on kids with ASD. It has very little to do with our simulation
                    design but I think they both share come core concepts. For example, they both express the importance
                    of motor, cognitive, and social skills. In my paper, I explain how video games can aid in the
                    overall performance of kids who typically lack in those areas. In our simulation, motor skills are
                    vital in order to win because in order to win, the players have to balance the plate and run at the
                    same time. Additionally, in both my paper and our simulation, there is a stress on communication.
                    For many kids with autism, communication and social skills are always difficult to maintain and
                    control. Video games can create virtual relationships with these kids to help with that. In our
                    simulation, communication is vital because each team needs to know when to run and when to pass the
                    plate. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                    streaming. It is very far from the Sim Design that our team created; however, there is a connection
                    between live streaming and the Sim Design. This is because live streaming help people to simulate
                    doing any exercises in a right way. The Sim Design that our group created is based on relay race.
                    People usually warm themselves up before they start running or playing any sports. For instance, I
                    usually watch one of famous Korean comedian’s live streaming. His live streaming is all about
                    playing soccer. His manager videotapes him playing soccer. Before he plays soccer, he tells viewers
                    that do not forget to warm yourself up. By warming up, it releases rigid parts of the body and
                    reduces the risk of heart damage. We tell people, who are participated in our game, do not forget
                    warm themselves up. Therefore, we can prevent participants’ injuries. It's not easy to make a new
                    game, test someone, and simulate it, but through this group project, I always have to simulate
                    before I do something, and simulation seems to be an important element that is needed everywhere.<i

                    can simulate some aspect of college life. Several great ideas were generated during the
                    conversation, and all four of us came to a consensus that our simulation would address the stress
                    college students experience. Senyan proposed a relay race that would simulate students who are
                    trying to meet a deadline to turn in their research paper, and each of the participants will make
                    independent choices that will decide how they run. Our team decided to build on this simulaiton
                    proposal, and we used a whiteboard to collaboratively design and iterate on the logistics.</p>

                        participants lean towards certain choices? Are these questions successful at simulating how
                        students choose under stress?</figcaption>
                </div>
                <p class="process">We playtested twice with peers from our discussion section and gained valuable
                    insights on design logistics that needed improvements. Based on participant feedback, we identified
                    some main problems and proposed the following changes:
                    <ul id="feedback-1">
                        <li>Before game started, we gathered all the participants to cover the general directions and
                            rules of the game. However, participants had trouble remembering what question they needed
                            to answer before they are sent to their respective stations. To solve this problem, we
                            decided to announce only the general rules and purpose of the simulaiton at the beginning,
                            then we send the runners from both teams to their respectice station, where they will get
                            the specific question that they need to answer and ask the facilitor at the station for
                            clarification. </li>
                        <li>We took too long to get the players ready. Senyan forgot to bring the weighted backpacks to
                            station two, and Kook forgot to put the tennis ball on one of the player's plate. To prevent
                            the hassle, we planned to set up all the materials at each station prior to game start,
                            and once the players made their choices, we will gear them up and prepare them for their
                            turn.</li>
                        <li>A player passed the plate to someone who is on the opposite team! This happened because he
                            did not remember who was on his team, and there was nothing that distinguished one team from
                            another. To prevent this from happening, we will line up two teams on two seperate sides,
                            and give everyone a sticky badge to write either "A" or "B" to indicate their team.</li>
                        <li>Participants from two teams inadventently made the same choice on every question. This
                            meant that the options were unbalanced and people chose options that had no time punishment.
                            There are two ways we plan to solve the problem. First, we will extend the running distance.
                            Since our initial distance was set at 30 feet per racer, even a 3-second time punishment is
                            too significant. We will increase the distance per racer to 160 feet. In addition, we will
                            tweak the duration of time punishment in every option and introduce more balance, so that
                            participants will not lean toward one option without much thinking. </li>

                students make choices regarding sleep, food, exercise, and most importantly, time management during
                stressful periods. The choices each participant makes will result in the consequences of their actions and
                determine their overall performance in the game. The goal is to turn in your research paper to your
                professor while managing important aspects of your daily life. You will be broken off into two groups of
                4, and each group will assign number 1 through 4 to every participant. This is the order that you will go. Number 1 from both team will
                report to station 1, and so on. Both stations 1 and 3 will be positioned at one end, and stations 2
                and 4 will be positioned at the other end. The plate acts as the baton of the relay race. As each person
                travels to the next station, they will have to balance a plate with different objects, because as life
                gets harder, there is a lot on everybody’s plate (wink wink). The objective is to finish the game as
                quickly as possible, while making conscientious decisions about your life. Whoever finishes first is the
                winner.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                <li class="review">Game was pretty balanced. It was fun racing and I enjoyed the fact
                    that there was some physical exercise in there!</li>
                <li class="review">Very fun game and simulated time management very well. Relay race
                    was great.</li>
                <li class="review">Great game, had a lot of fun, rules were well-explained.</li>
                <li class="review">
                    I enjoyed the translation of student life to game mechanics.</li>
                <li class="review">
                    I had alot of fun playing this game - probably the best simulation out of ones I have played so far. I liked how they combined the idea of a procrastinating student to various physical activities within their relay race - it was creative yet logical and easily relatable. The whole team divided race also added a competitive aspect to the game, which augments the players desire to win and therefore making the game more engaging and fun. </li>
                <li class="review">
                    Interesting way to simulate the panic of students trying to turn in papers. If only the choices in real life were as easy as in the game. Overall, I liked the concept, but I think a relay race fits more with something like a group project as opposed to trying to turn in / write a paper. Especially since we had to make our choices before the race without any of the other players on our team knowing.</li>
                    <li class="review">
                        This was a challenge - we had to balance a plate of books, papers and run, and also remember a password. This was less fun than the other games, since there was nothing to do after finishing my part, though they did say it is a relay race. The critique here is to manage your responsibilities (the plate) while managing the time (run only as fast as you can), there is a penalty of dropping stuff. Well executed, could have been designed better, but the critique here was stronger than the other two (more obvious). Relay race of managing responsibilities, time and making good decisions.</li>
